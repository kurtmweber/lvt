You can turn on debugging code (which gives some shortcuts during gameplay, e.g. hidden doors are marked
and creatures can be killed with a single hit) by uncommenting the line with "#define _D_DEBUG" in those
files where it exists (currently leveldisp.c and attack.c).  For some reason, defining it at compile time
with "make CFLAGS=-D_D_DEBUG" causes placeDoors to segfault.  No clue why.
