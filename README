You can turn on debugging code (which gives some shortcuts during gameplay, 
e.g. hidden doors are marked and creatures can be killed with a single hit) by 
uncommenting the line with "#define _D_DEBUG" in those files where it exists 
(currently leveldisp.c and attack.c).  For some reason, defining it at compile 
time with "make CFLAGS=-D_D_DEBUG" causes placeDoors to segfault.  No clue why.
